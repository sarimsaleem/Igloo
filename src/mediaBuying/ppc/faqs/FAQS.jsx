              Both are important. PPC, like Google Ads and Social Media Ads help a business generate traffic immediately and at scale. SEO creates more credibility as users generally trust brands that rank high on search engines organically. The downside of SEO that it takes a long time, and in any time can lose traffic due to competitors winning rankings.
